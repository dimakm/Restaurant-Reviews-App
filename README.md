GWG scholarship project 5

## Overview:

This project is created as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application:

- Clone or install the project to your local machine

- run git bash and change directory to the project folder, example : 
$ git cd c:/projectFolder 

- Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't    even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.navigate to Python's [website] (https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
